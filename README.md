# stock-analysis

## Overview 

In this project, we used VBA to analyze stock performace for a client using an excel data source. Initially, we analyzed one stock with the ticker DQ while using VBA to calculate the stock's Total Daily Volume and yearly returns. After creating this analysis, the code was then expanded out to analyze all stock's in the data source to identify which might be the most profitable for ongoing investment.
